# ðŸ¤“ Express JS on AWS Elastic beanstalk

An example setup to get your Express JS application deployed to AWS Elastic Beanstalk t2.micro. There's so quite a few config options and gotchas when setting up an instance, and this was the most basic setup I found for Node.

## App Setup

* Use the AWS console to navigate to Elastic Beanstalk and create a new NodeJS Application and environment
* Go to the Configuration tab and under "Software" set your Node -v to 8.11.4 and enter PORT=8081 in env vars
* Clone the repository
* Cd to dir and run `npm install`
* Install AWS tools and EB-cli (can be done with brew packages `awscli` and `aws-elasticbeanstalk`)
* Setup your dir with `eb init` and select previously setup Application
* Select your environment with `eb list` then `eb use <env-name>` (or `eb create` an env from the console)
* Run `eb deploy` to upload to AWS

## Run locally

* Rename `.env.example` => `.env` and set your env variables
* `npm start`
* Open http://localhost:8081/
